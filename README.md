Twitter Bot for RadberryPi.Tech code tutorial

This project is being built to create a tutorial for coding in golang. Let's make something useful, though.

I'd like a Twitter 'bot' to programmatically find the best current deals, or the best selling products at the moment and tweet them.

The first step is done. We have "hello world" tweets.  I've also started separating our secret logins, but that is going to change soon.

Next up is to find some deals to tweet!  For that, we'll be using the Amazon Product Advertising API, so you'll need to get that account started, and let me tell you, get comfortable before you start the process.
